# Tcl File I/O Error Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Tcl programming related to file I/O and error handling. The bug involves attempting to read from a file without proper error checking.  The solution shows how to correctly handle potential errors during file operations using Tcl's error handling mechanisms.

## Bug

The `bug.tcl` file contains the flawed code.  The code tries to open a file. If it fails, the `catch` command catches the error, but the program proceeds, leading to runtime errors.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.tcl` file provides the corrected version. It appropriately handles the file not found situation and provides informative error messages to the user.
